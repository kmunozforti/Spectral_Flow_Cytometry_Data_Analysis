# Spectral_Flow_Cytometry_Data_Analysis

**Project Title**
 A Customizable Spectral Flow Cytometry Analysis Pipeline

**Description**
This is an innovative analysis pipeline designed to enhance the interrogation of high-dimensional immune cell data through spectral flow cytometry. This pipeline addresses the complexities associated with large antibody panels and traditional bi-axial gating strategies, facilitating advanced analysis such as batch correction, unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction, and differential expression analysis. Developed in Python and leveraging Jupyter Notebook environments, This analysis methods also tailored to identify subtle nuances in immune cell populations across different life stages.

**Key Features**
**High-Dimensional Analysis:** Supports complex data sets with up to 50 fluorescently labeled antibodies.
**Customizable Panels:** Easily configurable for various immune cell profiling needs.
**Advanced Statistical Tools:** Implements sophisticated statistical techniques to extract meaningful insights from spectral data.
**User-Friendly Interface:** Utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for an accessible and interactive user experience.
